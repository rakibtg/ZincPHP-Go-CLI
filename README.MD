# ZincPHP CLI binary wrapper for Docker

The aim of this project is to letting you use the CLI of ZincPHP without having PHP installed in your computer.

## How it will work?

- You will download the binary for your choice of OS.
- Provide your docker container details in the `environment.json` file.
- Then use the binary to utilize ZincPHP's CLI tooling.

## Example:
```
./zincphp migrate:refresh
```

# Status
Still in development.
